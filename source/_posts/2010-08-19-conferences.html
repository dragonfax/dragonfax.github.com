I have trouble learning anything at conferences.
Though, I've only been to a few. This is a retelling of what I told one of the Splunk people at their conference. 
Its starts with; 

<br />
<blockquote>
"I'm probably just not the right type of person for conferences."
</blockquote>
Don't get me wrong. Their conference was great. 
But I'm one of the few people in the world that actually reads documentation... thoroughly. And Splunk is _very_ well documented. Better than most applications.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore I read blogs, lots of them. 
From that I not only gain the technical knowledge of 'cans' and 'cannots' but also use-cases, user experiences, corner cases, best practices and odd behavior.
<br />
<br />
Most sessions at conferences, end up being rehashes of what I've already read. With only a few small new tidbits in the entire hour or hour and a half. 
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I'm not a swag type of person. And usually if I was interested in talking with a company regarding their products, I would already have done so. Instead of waiting until I can meet them face-to-face in a exhibit hall.
<br />
<br />
I'll probably be at VMWorld in SF, and at Strangeloop, in St. Louis.
Before then, I'm hoping someone will chime in and tell me what I'm doing wrong</div>
