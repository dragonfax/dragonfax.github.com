I don't know how I feel about this recent trend of installing and using software
without a package manager.

how this pattern should be used.

benefits of a package manager.
* migration tasks
* cleanup/uninstall tasks, lifetime generated files

this is done when you maybe altering the 3rd party source further.


examples

  chef

    version your own config and cookbooks
    3rd party cookbooks submodules
      no dependency management though
      dependent cookbooks are just documented

  vundle

    I don't know what vundle does when you 'install'
    can use submodules though

  octopress

    rake tasks


also

  using git repos as a package system.
  and github as a package ditribution system.
