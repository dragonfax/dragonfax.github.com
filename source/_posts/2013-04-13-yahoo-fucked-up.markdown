Note: be warned, rant ahead.

when I start up my web browser
and I find that my homepage is now yahoo
and mwhen I type a search it searches on yahoo
the a yahoo search widget is added to my toolbar

and then I have to look up how to change the default search
then I succesfully do this.
and test it

yet after resarch the search engine is back to yahoo.


of course I'm annoyed by whatever third party production
I installed, and did this without making it obvious it was
going to do this.

but I'm mostly angry at you yahoo.

because the way I see, it you paid someone to fuck up mysystem.
and to fuck it up bad.
to ruin my workflows
to slow me down
to force me to spend an hour trying to fix it.
you paid someone to do this to me.
you fucked up bad yahoo.
becuase you paid someone to fuck up my system.


Yahoo, why did you pay someone to fuck up my system?
