Everyone seems to have an opinion on this one.&nbsp; Now that Google Wave has been put in the can, its getting some revived press.&nbsp; I've never understood the mysticism assigned to it.&nbsp; It seems rather straightforward to me.&nbsp; Its just a collaborative document edting system.&nbsp; Conceptually you could think of it as just another wiki.<br />
<br />
<h4>








Wiki</h4>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Users can edit it, including editing what the previous users added.</li>
<li>&nbsp;history is kept and can be inspected through the UI</li>
</ul>
<br />
&nbsp; It adds a realtime editing feature, where you can see others making changes to the document live.&nbsp; Whether thats an important feature or not is left in the open.&nbsp; The realtime editing is nice, but I've rarely seen it helpful in online collaboration.&nbsp; Besides I don't think thats part of the design of their protocol, its just a feature of their front-end implementation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The one situation it has been helpful is when you're<br />
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;working on a specific document, like a requirmenets doc,</li>
<li>&nbsp;with other people,</li>
<li>&nbsp;who your in other realtime communication with, such as over chat, voice or in person.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Notification or "adding people" to the wave, is no different from getting email notifications when someone edits a wiki page your following or have previously edited.<br />
<br />
<h4>






Email</h4>
<ul>
<li>The documents are like "threads".</li>
<li>You get notified of additions/changes to the thread.</li>
</ul>
<br />
&nbsp; Its good replacement for long threads.&nbsp; Long meandering threads would quickly get policed back onto track.&nbsp; Because of the constant presence of the full history, and the editable nature of the full thread.&nbsp; But again, this is the case for any wiki.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; In the spirit of email, the backend presents it as a decentralized repository.&nbsp; Allowing integration and distribution with other repos.&nbsp; Thats a new concept for online collaboration systems, but it never branched out for them. With Google as the only provider.<br />
<br />
<h4>

Chat</h4>
<br/>
&nbsp; Its not a chat system.&nbsp; I never understood this comparison.&nbsp; That would be too random, off-topic, long term.&nbsp; It would quickly become more of a 'history' of the chat, than an actual chat.&nbsp; And keeping it on topic without constant editing of all the history would be impossible.<br />
<br />
<h4>

Conclusion</h4>
<br/>
I did think it was a good idea.&nbsp; I love wiki's, online collaboration, and collective intelligence of any kind.&nbsp; Perhaps, if they had provided some of the other front-ends instead of their complicated "wave" UI, it would have seen more wide-spread use.<br />
<h5>



Email</h5>
<ul>
<li>receive updates as regular emails, possibly containing context as a 'fake threaed'</li>
<li>reply with reponses that get inserted appropriately back into the document.</li>
</ul>
<h5>


Wiki</h5>
<ul>
<li>static html of each wave</li>
<li>editing the document in a normal wiki fashion.</li>
</ul></div>
