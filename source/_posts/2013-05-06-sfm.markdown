I like to guess at how things are developed.
or how I might develop it.

here is a guess at how the source filmmaker works

first we have the issue that 

* this is all based on a game engine
not a traditional computer animation system.
so we have a system optimized and simplified for running a vidoe game/FPS.
this implies a lot.

maps loaded entirely into memory
bone animations
  merged
not one big mesh
screengraph at the core
limited details on the models in the world
  low poly models

"late project story changes"

physics build into the map and models.s
physical simulation
along with all the various levels (tracks) of data added.

capture motion
insert that motion into a character, in another session
model motion from scratch
  (bones I think)
  which ean create motion and edit it later.

? can you do arbitrary model mesh hacking later? or is it only bones and faces that can be done


the big question, is how to add all of these features to what is originally optimized to be a game
without turning the whole thing into a beast.
making it a full animation system.
building a new product
re-engineering it around a different core idiom.
i.e. hwo to easily add these features to what we, mostly, already have in the game engine


? how demo's use to be done
  recording and playback of a game.
