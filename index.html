  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The Search for Spock</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m always looking for better ways to organizing my life and improving my personal productivity. One tool thats popped up in several discussion is Trello. I know a few people using it, as a flexible online board for managing their workload, both professionally and personally. It seems like a great idea to try to work this into my own arsenal and see if its the godsend all the hype leads me to believe.</p>

<p>After a little research and toying around, I did find it particularly flexible, but I also found that most examples on the web use Trello in the same way, with the same pattern of usage.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Trello&#8221;, by Trello</h2>

<p>Trello provides the expected help documentation, describing the features, how to find them, adding components, and work with the widgets in the application.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what they don&#8217;t provide is specific usage patterns.  They don&#8217;t describe workflows or methods to use the product for various ends. Instead leaving that up to other online examples or for the user to figure it out on his own.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen this before with online products and its always a point of annoyance for me.  While I understand leaving things open ended so that users can find their own ways to take advantage of the product, and not pidgin-hole it into one niche. Not leaving product held back by preconceptions of what a it should be or how it should be used.</p>

<p>But, by not giving clear instructions on how some people use it, or how you think it <strong>could</strong> be used for new users early on, you just make it difficult for users to get into the service, in the first place.</p>

<p>Twitter has the same issue. They refuse to clearly define the service and how it should be used.  And its wasted, as those who find new ways to use tools won&#8217;t be deterred by the predefinition of its use.  i.e. The hashtag would still have been invented, whether it was the Twitter docs or not.</p>

<h3>Vocabulary</h3>

<p>Lets go over some Trello vocabulary quickly, or at least what they define for users. Teaching you how to use Trello is outside of the scope of this post, so I&#8217;m just going to review the terms, not describe them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Board</strong>
Groups Lists together.</li>
<li><strong>List</strong> (of cards)</li>
<li><strong>Card</strong>
Groups everything else together, a description with any number of <strong>comments</strong> and <strong>checklists</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Checklist</strong>
Works like a &#8220;Todo&#8221; list.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

<p>The built-in structure or relationship between these components  within Trello is pretty simple to lay out.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>account</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>boards</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>lists</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>cards</strong>

<ul>
<li>card <strong>title</strong></li>
<li>card <strong>description</strong></li>
<li><strong>checklists</strong></li>
<li><strong>comments</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Board = Process/Workflow</h2>

<p>The pattern I see most often used online for Trello is a simple board->workflow pattern, where a <strong>board</strong> represents one &#8220;workflow&#8221; which may have several &#8220;steps&#8221; within it. In this case each &#8220;step&#8221; is represented by a <strong>list</strong>.</p>

<p>In this system, the cards represent work items that are running through the &#8220;workflow&#8221;. They rest in the &#8220;list&#8221; that pertains to the step in the workflow that they currently reside.</p>

<p>This might be similar to a tool used for scrum tracking.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>board</strong> -> &#8220;workflow&#8221; or process</li>
<li><strong>list</strong> -> &#8220;step&#8221; within the &#8220;workflow&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>card</strong> -> item (project/task/feature/workload) running through the &#8220;workflow&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>Here the details within the card are used for describing and tracking the item or project that&#8217;s running through the &#8220;workflow&#8221;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2013-05-06-trello_examples_khan_academy.png">_</p>

<p>A notable feature in this pattern is that <strong>cards</strong> are often moved from <strong>list</strong> to <strong>list</strong> as a daily activity, usually serially from one <strong>list</strong> to the next. And eventually <strong>cards</strong> are removed from the <strong>board</strong> (archived) when they run off the end of the process.</p>

<h2>Other Patterns</h2>

<p>I do see a few other patterns in use but they are rare.</p>

<h3>Categorized List of &#8220;Things&#8221;</h3>

<p>Using the <strong>board</strong> as a single list, but with categories within that list.  Each <strong>card</strong> being one of the &#8220;things&#8221; that the <strong>board</strong> is listing.  And the different <strong>lists</strong> within the <strong>board</strong> are the categories.</p>

<p>Usually in this case the title of the <strong>card</strong> is all that&#8217;s needed to describe the &#8220;thing&#8221;.  And the comments within the <strong>cards</strong> are simply a running commentary from various users on the &#8220;thing&#8221; itself.</p>

<p>Trello&#8217;s own list of examples serves as a good representation of this pattern.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2013-05-06-trello_examples_trello_resources.png">_</p>

<p>Notably, in this pattern, <strong>cards</strong> are regularly added to <strong>lists</strong>, but never moved between <strong>lists</strong> or removed at all.  The <strong>board</strong> acts as a canonical list of items, without expiration.</p>

<h2>Missing Features</h2>

<p>After trying to use Trello for my own todo list management I found it rather lacking (for my own purposes). I&#8217;m still going to search for ways to use it for project planning and managing current work.</p>

<p>My habit it to use a large a powerful todo list (toodledo) for tracking most of my work backlog. Even if I were to organize all my backlog in the form of boards, lists, and cards, I&#8217;d be missing out of important searching/sorting/categorization features that come along with the simple relational table model that online todo lists use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Merging and sorting all checklists in a board.
  Gather all checklists on a board into one super checklist to see what I should be working on immediately.
  Without having to dig around through cards and lists for checklists.
  This would be even more useful across boards.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional checklist details.
  Such as tagging checklist items with labels, and including more info for each individual checklist item.</p></li>
<li><p>Full-Text Search, across all text
  It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find text elements that are not included in a Trello search. This is a little surprising.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Call For Papers</h2>

<p>I&#8217;d love to see some other Trello usage patterns if anyone out there has them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>For Whom The Bell Tolls.</h3>

<p>As previously mentioned, I use VIM rather heavily, and I have some OCD behaviors when doing so, which includes hitting &lt;escape&gt; a lot. So I like to turn off the bell sounds vi makes on errors and unnecessary commands.</p>

<h3>IdeaVim</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m also a heavy user of IdeaVim plugin for IntelliJ. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to use IDEs at all without those plugins that add VI operation modes to the built-in editors.</p>

<p>IdeaVim doesn&#8217;t document very well how it differs from true VIM. The project owner has taken the philosophy of building the project based on the original VIM documentation, and not the VIM source. So much so that the documentation for the plugin is just the VIM docs copied over.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they&#8217;ve taken no time to indicate how much of that documented behavior is implemented and how much isn&#8217;t yet.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>One important area where VIM and IdeaVim differ is their handling of settings. IdeaVim only supports a small subset of vim commands and settings variables. But it wants to provide some convenience and backwards compatibility for existing VIM users. Their solution is to read your ~/.vimrc anyways. It simply has the behavior of silently ignoring any settings it doesn&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>Unfortunately IdeaVim doesn&#8217;t understand</p>

<p><code>:set noerrorbells</code></p>

<h3>It Toles for <em>Thee!</em></h3>

<p>Fortunately IdeaVim <strong>does</strong> understand</p>

<p><code>:set visualbell</code></p>

<p>And better yet, it has no implementation for visualbells, so it simply silennces the error bell when you enact this setting. I just had to ensure the visualbell option was in my .vimrc before the noerrorbells option, so the latter would take final effect in real VIM.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using Evernote for taking notes for a while now. But I really miss taking notes in VIM.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m a heavy VIM user. I use it for coding, through and though. So much so, that I use VIM-style editor wrapper plugins IDEs such as Eclipse and IntelliJ. Otherwise I find normal &#8216;editors&#8217; clunky and un-usable.</p>

<p>When it comes to coding I&#8217;m clearly more productive, and happy in a VI like environment, with command modes, regular expressions, and no need for a mouse or arrow keys. It only made sense that I&#8217;d use VIM for taking notes and tracking my work.</p>

<p>But the pull of Evernote to manage all that non-coding work was very strong.  The convenience of having notes online, available on every platform including mobile and web, is just something I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>

<h3>My Solution</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on an Evernote Command Line Client in ruby for a little while now.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/dragonfax/rnote">Rnote</a></p>

<p>Its not yet ready for prime time, yet. Its missing the final touches. But its far enough along for me to use for my own daily note-taking.</p>

<p>The real driving force behind this project was to allow me to take notes using VIM, but still backed by Evernote.</p>

<p>I can fire up:</p>

<p><code>$ rnote edit "note title"</code></p>

<p>And rnote will pull down the note, convert it to text, and open it in a copy of VIM.  Then it watches the file and saves it back to Evernote every time I save the file in my editor.</p>

<p>Returning to VIM just feels right.</p>

<h3>Realization</h3>

<p>The interesting thing I found, when returning to VIM after a long absense, was that I&#8217;m less afraid of change in the VIM world. Its not just a matter of simple productvity via keypress count and typing speed. But there&#8217;s apprehension when I&#8217;m working in an editor that&#8217;s buried in manyl layers of disparate applications.</p>

<p>When working in a text area in a browsoer, or in an editor embedded in a desktop app, there are several layers on top of that editor. Each providing their own &#8216;modes&#8217; and shortscuts and commands. Each taking priority over the other for different types of input. And each capable of changing the your entire world in the middle of an editing session, with one bad keypress.</p>

<p>If I fat finger a typing sequence in some custom editor, anything can happen. And the results, I&#8217;ve found, can be unexpected and incomprehensible. I&#8217;ve had experiences where the cursor leaps to a random location in the text, drops a few lines from the text, and starts adding new characters after breaking the formatting that was already there. Other situations have seen my input leap to another document, and start making changes there. And then there is the worse case scenerio of the window just closing altogether, lossing of editor history, and without any sort of save.</p>

<p>VIM is an environment I can predict. And its only one environment providing the UI.  No matter what happens, I know all I have to do is hit &#8216;u&#8217; and magically any bad typing sequence is completely undone. And best of all, if I did type something wrong, I probably know what it was from the effects that occured. Because VIM has a consice and regular interface that hasn&#8217;t changed over the years, and doesn&#8217;t change between nvironments.</p>

<p>Of course, I lose WYSIWYG formatting (do we still use that word?), such as bold, italic, and font sizes.  But I don&#8217;t really miss them.  And I get back indentation, a powerful organization tool. Just ask the python guys.</p>

<h3>Plans</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m planning to add markdown support, so that I cna have the best of both worlds: pure text editing, but also allow for some formatting. I&#8217;m already used to markdown elsewhere in the web, such as octopress and github.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>A Beginners Guide</h2>

<p>I use RubyMine without doing any rails and doing just what you ask. I write a lot of simple scripts, and large applications, both often usable from a command line.</p>

<p>I still organize my code into a &#8216;project directory&#8217;. And point RM at that directory. Instead of just working entirely in a file, and trying to point RM at the file alone. This seems to be what IDE&#8217;s prefer. This lets RM create its <code>.idea</code> directory to hold all of its project related settings.</p>

<p>This may mean that some projects consist of nothing more than a directory (for the project) and a single file in that directory (the single script which is really the only content in that project).</p>

<h2>Benefits of a Project Directory</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ll soon find you add more files to any project anyways. Both additional coding and various utilities which are part of the great benefit of ruby.</p>

<ul>
<li>gem</li>
<li>rake</li>
<li>tests</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>project directory</code> pattern, also lets you version the code with popular VCS such as git, and even upload to social coding sites like github.</p>

<h2>Project Setup</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t bother with any sort of &#8220;project type&#8221;. In fact I don&#8217;t create projects from with RubyMine at all. I just create a directory, and then open that directory with RM (whether from the File Menu, or via the &#8220;mine&#8221; command line tool that RM installs).</p>

<p><code>project/</code></p>

<p>Of course <code>project</code> isn&#8217;t the real name of the project, or the directory I create, I&#8217;m just using it as a generic name here. I would actually name the directory (and project) after the scripts or subject matter of the work they do.</p>

<p>NOTE: <em>currently there is a bug in the <code>mine</code> command in RM 5 where it won&#8217;t open a second project window.</em></p>

<p>Obviously if this is a project that includes any command line scripts I&#8217;ll put those in a <code>bin</code> directory, just for organization purposes. I don&#8217;t like to clutter the root project directory with all sorts of things. There are too many tools that <em>require</em> their settings files in the project root, so the fewer the better.</p>

<p><code>project/bin/</code></p>

<p>Like I said, various other utilities prefer their settings files in the project root, so you may find yourself using some of them.</p>

<pre><code>project/Gemfile
project/Rakefile
project/project.gemspec
project/README.md
project/.rdoc_options
...
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as I have some automated testing for the scripts (which I admit isn&#8217;t immediate) I put all test code under a <code>test</code> directory, but I further categorize those according to the scope of the tests or how often I would run them during development. And I&#8217;ll go so far as to add quck Rake tasks that are just aliases for the commands necessary to run the tests. So I dont&#8217; have to remember which test runner, or type the full paths each time.</p>

<pre><code>project/test/
project/test/unit/
project/test/unit/some_component_test.rb
project/test/integration/
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, as the project grows, and I add more scripts or want to reuse some of the code within external projects, I&#8217;ll add a <code>lib</code> directory, and use some standard practices for how to organize that.</p>

<pre><code>project/lib/
project/lib/project.rb
</code></pre>

<p>And as the project continues to grow and get more complicated, more organization of the content is required, after a little refactoring. Note the <code>cmd</code> directory to contain the actual top-level code of various workflows a particular script can go through.</p>

<pre><code>project/lib/project/
project/lib/project/other_stuff.rb
project/lib/project/cmd/
project/lib/project/cmd/one_command.rb
project/lib/project/cmd/another_command.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the original <code>project.rb</code> &#8216;requires&#8217; all of these lib files. Ruby loads pretty fast, so I don&#8217;t bother too much with managing dependencies between the ruby files within the same project. Its really all about code readability.</p>

<h2>Better Command Line Apps</h2>

<p>There is nothing wrong with starting with a single script file and writing minimal boiler plate coding. And thats probably the best way to start.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

=begin

this is a script blah which does whatever

EXAMPLE

$ script &lt;options&gt; &lt;arguments

=end

def main(args)
  whatever
end

main(ARGV)
exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>But writing even better command line apps in ruby is pretty easy. There are popular gems which handle a lot of the infrastructure for you.</p>

<p>You can start with something as simple as <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html">OptionParser</a></p>

<p>Then as you build more code in your scripts you can graduate to a bit more infrastructure with a gem like <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/methadone">Methadone</a></p>

<p>Finally, when you&#8217;re writing full blown command line applications, with many &#8220;internal&#8221; commands like &#8220;git submodule init <repo>&#8221;, you can ascend to something much more heavy-weight like <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/gli">GLI</a></p>

<h2>Testing Command Line Apps</h2>

<p>Unit testing is the pretty much the same, no matter what type of application your writing. You&#8217;re not using real services or combining components, but just isolating the internal components and using them in a purely internal manner. So not much changes there for command line tools.</p>

<p>But when it comes to integration or full command-line testing of my scripts, I&#8217;m actually a big fan of <code>cucumber/aruba</code>. I&#8217;m not big on TDD, I&#8217;m a bit too pragmatic for that. But for command line tools, the series of use cases is already laid out pretty plainly in the set of options available. Even for interactive commands this makes a series of <code>feature</code> files conveniently double as documentation for the tool.</p>

<pre><code>Feature:
  Create and manipulate notes in Evernote.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as me
    And I have 0 notes

  Scenario: Show note
    Given that I have 1 note named "foo" with content "bar"
    When I run `rnote show note --title "foo"`
    Then the output should contain "bar"

  Scenario: Show note, from multiple notes
    Given that I have 2 notes named "foo"
    When I run `rnote show note --title "foo"` interactively
    And I type "1"
    Then the output should contain "foo"
</code></pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As for installation and packaging for your scripts, so that they can be shared and reused by the rest of the world, look no further than the same &#8216;gem&#8217; utility that you&#8217;ve already been using all along in ruby for depenencies.</p>

<p>The <code>gemspec</code> you create when writing a new gem to share, can be told about your scripts and other command line utilities. It will then wrap them up with the rest of your code, install them in a good location, and even fix up the PATH so the user can find them when the time comes.</p>

<p>In fact this works so well, your gem can be composed of nothing but these <code>bin</code> scripts. With no other re-usable code included.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dragonfax/cat-dog">cat-dog</a> is a harmless little gem I whipped up as an example for something else. It contains no lib directory at all and no other ruby other than a single command line script.</p>

<h2>Ruby Without Rails</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve run into a lot of Rails developers who aren&#8217;t cognisant of what <em>is</em> Rails and what <em>is</em> ruby. i.e. what you&#8217;re left with when you remove the Rails. Obviously the server and templating, databasing, MVC are all gone, as are a portion of convenience methods added to every-day objects.</p>

<p>The goods new is that you&#8217;re still left with quite a lot. And if you find you miss something, its easy to add it back in with by including a gem or two. For instance, if you enjoy using an ORM like active-record it can be included back into your application, without rails, with little fuss.</p>

<pre><code>require 'activerecord'
</code></pre>

<h2>Full Featured RubyMine</h2>

<p>Finally, using RubyMine features more heavily during development. Everything available when working with rails is available for command line applications.</p>

<p>You can run your commands from RM and use its debugger just the same as rails.
Just like any IDE you can set up &#8220;run&#8221; profiles with the arguments you want to test the script on, and run or debug the script through the IDE. Personally, I never use a command-line debugger. If I need to fire up a debugger to troubleshoot some issue, then I&#8217;ll launch the program in an IDE. The benefits of an IDE debugger with &#8220;heads-up&#8221; display of all the pertinent details, and visually following the script through execution, is just irreplaceable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How I choose to work has changed over the years, naturally.
Learning new technologies and techniques.
New hammers and tools to put on my belt.</p>

<p>An important part of this was how I went about
choosing what technologies to associate myself with.
I didn&#8217;t just let people set things down in front of me, and choose my paths for me.
I constantly researched and pro-actively vetted technological choices.
Its been a constant daily regimine.</p>

<p>A notable area of focus for programmers is the choice a programming language to use for any given peice of code.
And this serves, ideally, as a great example to show how these patterns have changed over the years.</p>

<p>Let me describe this in 3 phases.</p>

<h2>When I was young</h2>

<p>When I was a new programmer, my focus was entirely on what language seemed best for me.</p>

<p>Not simply what matched my world view,
but also what forced me to absorb new ideas and concepts.
What allowed for my personal productivity, but also my personal growth.</p>

<p>Also, at this stage it was all about what the &#8220;best langugae&#8221; was.
As opinionated as I was, I never considered adding a &#8220;for me&#8221; to the end of that
statement to better qualify it as purely a personal journey.
I was in a world of absolutes, and languages were something I could qualitatively compare.</p>

<p><strong>When I was young, I chose the best language for myself.</strong></p>

<h2>As I matured</h2>

<p>As I matured and gained in experience and languages,
I grew to see that there was no superior choice, across the board.
Different tools are simply better at different jobs.</p>

<p>Its not a good carpenter that judges all of his work should be done with a hammer.
But to apply the hammer to the nails and the saw to the wood.</p>

<p>Learning a language was just pre-emptive maneuver to ensure I could make the right choice
for each task that came up. And I knew that choice would change from job to job.
Each languaging becoming a table of pros and cons, with some lending to certain techniques
but performing poorly with others.</p>

<p><strong>As I matured, I chose the right language for the project.</strong></p>

<h2>Deep into my career</h2>

<p>Years later, as I&#8217;ve touched on most major technologies my world view has shifted yet again.</p>

<p>Truth be told, you can do pretty much anything with any programming language.</p>

<p>Yes, there are still pros and cons to languages, and language agnostic techniques as well.
There are differences in availablity and quality of 3rd party libraries and even in the communities
that follow them.</p>

<p>But what it really comes down to is not how <em>I&#8217;m</em> going to use the language,
Or even how the project is going to use the language.
But, rather, how the people are going to use the language.</p>

<p>Those team-members I have to work with now.
Those developers that may have to maintain this code in the future.
Those engineers that may have to make other technology decisions based
on the content of the projects and work I do.</p>

<p><strong> As a Late-Career Software Engineer, I make the choice based on the people, team, and company. </strong></p>
