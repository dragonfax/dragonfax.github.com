    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Coding and Legislature</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why we don&rsquo;t employ standard software engineering practices when creating laws.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comments, Documentation, Readable Code</li>
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>Boilerplate and DRY</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Modularity</li>
<li>Code Reviews</li>
<li>Beta Testing</li>
<li>Use Cases, Case Scenarios, Feature Testing</li>
<li>User Experience and Interface Design</li>
</ul>


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Clearly, written laws not meant to be understood by laymen.  That&rsquo;s okay though, we have compilers that translate our English code into binary form.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m not saying write laws as a form of code, or even pseudo code. Thats a bit extreme.  But readable code is considered to be goal, not a detriment.  When we can&rsquo;t write legible code, we add comments to explain the purpose of the line or stanza.  We&rsquo;ll even document the code and its entire processes externally elsewhere, to help others follow along with our intentions.</p>

<p>Often we&rsquo;ll take the extra step of designing the process first, before any code is written.  Using English and obtaining agreement from all concerns parties on the &ldquo;design&rdquo; of the process before starting the actual implementation.</p>

<p>With this implementation kept separate from the design and intention, we can obtain agreement on the &ldquo;goals&rdquo; of said process.  And if we can&rsquo;t reach an agreement on the implementation of the process then it turns out we really didn&rsquo;t have agreement on the design. Or the design wasn&rsquo;t clear enough to begin with.</p>

<h3>Design Patterns and Refactoring</h3>

<p>When code gets hard to understand we employ various maneuvers to keep it readable, understandable, and maintainable.</p>

<p>We break off pieces of the code into other projects, other files.  Abstracting and refactoring the commonalities, breaking out the patterns, and rewriting the code into something more concise, that conveys just the notion it was meant to.</p>

<h3>Version Control and Code Reviews</h3>

<p>Our &ldquo;code review&rdquo; process today in the law making process is well known to be terrible. Many laws and versions of laws are never inspected by all the necessary law makers before making it into the books.</p>

<p>We tend to employ simple version control techniques to follow the changes made to code over time. Pull request are an idea way to implement Code Reviews to ensure every change is heavily vetted before its made live.</p>

<h3>Testing, Testing, Testing</h3>

<p>We test a lot in software engineering. We find ways to verify the behavior of a piece of code before it does live, or more importantly, verify that we haven&rsquo;t improperly altered the previous behavior of code after we&rsquo;ve changed it.</p>

<p>Review laws and apply them, experimentally, against previously recorded and vetted case scenarios.  Existing people, real or fictitious, who embody the traits effected by these laws.  Do they effect people they shouldn&rsquo;t.  And can we somehow prove that they actually effect the change they desire to make?</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t we have a single state or section of the country where new laws are tried out experimentally before they pass for the entire country?</p>

<h3>Human Experience</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can a normal person understand the law, its purpose, its effects?</li>
<li>Does it seem nonsensical, convoluted to everyone other than the author?</li>
<li>Can an average person understand what to do to live by that law, and to avoid breaking it.</li>
<li>Finally, does it improve or reduce the happiness in a persons life or break our fundamental freedoms and human rights?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Wrap Up</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a general analogy here between Code and Law. A think there&rsquo;s more similarity than difference between them.</p>

<p>Now this is, of course, a very immature proposal.  You know they say that when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.  And, full disclosure, I am a Software Engineer, after all.</p>

<p>But I suppose there are probably some carpenters out there that think driving a nail into the head of every representative would be a great way to solve all of our legal problems.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Disillusionment as a Service</h3>

<p>Listening to a friend talk a little bit about her own trouble getting involved in charity work and social change organizations, reminded me of how hard it was for me to get into the regular practice of &ldquo;Giving&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I fought against was the simple idea that my little bit couldn&rsquo;t possibly make a difference.  And that going out there and helping was just to make me feel better, in a conceited sort of way.  I had to get past that, and see that every bit does count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disillusionment in our ability to actually effect any real change.&rdquo;  Its a big problem that people fight with today, especially the youth, when it comes to getting involved in politics, volunteering, donating to charity organizations.</p>

<h3>Visualization is the Bane to Disillusionment</h3>

<p>We need to find a way to see how your bit of change (literal or figurative) combines with that of others.  Not just for one or two charities at a time, but with all organizations. To show you that you really are making a difference, even just your little bit.  Because it gets added to your friends little bits, and everyone else&rsquo;s little its.  This helps people to visualize the impact of their change.</p>

<p>Its the same mentality you see in a demonstration.  You get see the power of people coming together.  And reminded your not alone here.  You can make change when you all come together.</p>

<p>This is something thats not easily seen with the systems in place today.  And visualizing would make it easy to believe.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A little more Trello in my life]]></title>
    <link href="http://dragonfax.github.com/blog/2013/05/06/trello/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-06T14:32:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dragonfax.github.com/blog/2013/05/06/trello</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Search for Spock</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for better ways to organizing my life and improving my personal productivity. One tool that has popped up in several discussion is Trello. I know a few people using it as a flexible online board for managing their workload, both professionally and personally. It seems like a great idea to work this into my own arsenal and see if its the godsend all the hype leads me to believe.</p>

<p>After a little research and toying around I did find it particularly flexible. But I also found that most examples on the web use Trello in the exact same way with the same pattern of usage.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Trello&rdquo;, by Trello</h2>

<p>Trello provides the expected help documentation, describing the features, how to find them, add elements, and work with the widgets in the application.</p>

<p>On the other hand what they don&rsquo;t provide is specific usage patterns.  They don&rsquo;t describe workflows or methods to use the product for various ends. Instead leaving that up to other online examples or for the user to figure it out on his/her own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this before with online products and its always a point of annoyance for me.  While I understand leaving things open-ended so that users can find their own ways to take advantage of the product, and not pidgin-hole it into one niche.</p>

<p>But by not giving clear instructions or even just examples on how some people use it, or how you think it <strong>could</strong> be used for new users early on, you just make it difficult for users to get into the service in the first place.</p>

<p>Twitter has the same issue. They refuse to clearly define the service and how it should be used.  And its a waste, as those who find new ways to use tools won&rsquo;t be deterred by the predefinition of its use.  i.e. The hashtag would still have been invented, whether it was in the Twitter docs or not.</p>

<h3>Vocabulary</h3>

<p>Lets go over some Trello vocabulary quickly, or at least what they define for users. Teaching you how to use Trello is outside of the scope of this post, so I&rsquo;m just going to review the terms.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Board</strong> &ndash; Groups Lists together.</li>
<li><strong>List</strong> (of cards)</li>
<li><strong>Card</strong> &ndash; Groups everything else together, a description with any number of <strong>comments</strong> and <strong>checklists</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Checklist</strong> &ndash; Works like a &ldquo;Todo&rdquo; list.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

<p>The built-in structure or relationship between these components  within Trello is pretty simple to lay out.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>account</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>boards</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>lists</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>cards</strong>

<ul>
<li>card <strong>title</strong></li>
<li>card <strong>description</strong></li>
<li><strong>checklists</strong></li>
<li><strong>comments</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Board = Process/Workflow</h2>

<p>The pattern I see most often used online for Trello is a simple board->workflow pattern, where a <strong>board</strong> represents one &ldquo;workflow&rdquo; which may have several &ldquo;steps&rdquo; within it. In this case each &ldquo;step&rdquo; is represented by a <strong>list</strong>.</p>

<p>In this system, the cards represent work items that are running through the &ldquo;workflow&rdquo;. They rest in the &ldquo;list&rdquo; that pertains to the step in the workflow where they currently reside.  This might be similar to a tool used for scrum tracking.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>board</strong> &ndash;> &ldquo;workflow&rdquo; or process</li>
<li><strong>list</strong> &ndash;> &ldquo;step&rdquo; within the &ldquo;workflow&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>card</strong> &ndash;> item (project/task/feature/workload) running through the &ldquo;workflow&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Here, the details within the card are used for describing and tracking the item or project that&rsquo;s running through the &ldquo;workflow&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="http://dragonfax.github.com/images/posts/2013-05-06-trello_examples_khan_academy.png">_</p>

<p>A notable feature in this pattern is that <strong>cards</strong> are often moved from <strong>list</strong> to <strong>list</strong> as a daily activity, usually serially from one <strong>list</strong> to the next. And eventually <strong>cards</strong> are removed from the <strong>board</strong> (archived) when they run off the end of the process.</p>

<h2>Other Patterns</h2>

<p>I do see a few other patterns in use but they&rsquo;re rare.</p>

<h3>Categorized List of &ldquo;Things&rdquo;</h3>

<p>This pattern uses the <strong>board</strong> as a single list of items, but with categories within that list.  Each <strong>card</strong> being one of the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that the <strong>board</strong> is listing.  And the different <strong>lists</strong> within the <strong>board</strong> are the categories.</p>

<p>Usually in this case the title of the <strong>card</strong> is all that&rsquo;s needed to describe the &ldquo;thing&rdquo;.  And the comments within the <strong>cards</strong> are simply a running commentary from various users on the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; itself.</p>

<p>Trello&rsquo;s own list of examples serves as a good representation of this pattern.</p>

<p><img src="http://dragonfax.github.com/images/posts/2013-05-06-trello_examples_trello_resources.png">_</p>

<p>Notably, in this pattern, <strong>cards</strong> are regularly added to <strong>lists</strong>, but never moved between <strong>lists</strong> or removed at all.  The <strong>board</strong> acts as a canonical list of items, without expiration.</p>

<h2>Missing Features</h2>

<p>After trying to use Trello for my own todo list management I found it rather lacking (for my own purposes, that is). I&rsquo;m still going to search for ways to use it for project planning and managing current work.</p>

<p>My habit it to use a large a powerful todo list (toodledo) for tracking most of my work backlog. Even if I were to organize all my backlog in the form of boards, lists, and cards, I&rsquo;d be missing important searching/sorting/categorization features that come along with the simple relational table model that online todo lists use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Merging and sorting all checklists in a board.</p>

<p>  Gather all checklists on a board into one super checklist to see what I should be working on immediately.
  Without having to dig around through cards and lists for checklists.
  This would be even more useful across boards.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional checklist details.</p>

<p>  Such as tagging checklist items with labels, and including more info for each individual checklist item.</p></li>
<li><p>Full-Text Search, across all text</p>

<p>  It wasn&rsquo;t too hard to find text elements that are not included in a Trello search. This is a little surprising.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Call For Papers</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see some other Trello usage patterns if anyone out there has them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Note: be warned, rant ahead.</p>

<h2>The Incident</h2>

<p>My homepage is now yahoo. A site I never use, never have used, never will use.</p>

<p>My default search is now Yahoo. Again, a service I will never use. (even more so now)</p>

<p>An ugly and useless yahoo search widget is added to my toolbar. It takes up precious real-estate.</p>

<p>Worse, these changes seem to be permanent. Or at least damn close to it. After various fiddling and config settings, most of this remains. I&rsquo;m unable to correct the hacking that was done to my computer.</p>

<p>Furthermore this takes up precious time, searching, fixing, searching some more.</p>

<h2>The Culprit</h2>

<p>Of course this was was all done by some third-party extension or product I don&rsquo;t recall installing. I probably missed some tiny little button somewhere tha says, effectively, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t fuck up my computer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But its all too late for that to matter now. The damage is already done.</p>

<h2>The Blame</h2>

<p>But who I&rsquo;m really angry at is Yahoo.  The way I see it, Yahoo paid someone to fuck up my computer. And I take that personally.</p>

<p>They paid someone to break my computer, and waste my time trying to fix it. And they paid alot
considering how hard it is to undo this mess.</p>

<p>They wanted to make absolutely sure that a good portion of my afternoon was ruined, correcting
this dubochery.</p>

<h2>The Plea</h2>

<p>What did I do do to you, Yahoo?  Why would you do this to me?</p>

<p>Was a lark? a laugh?  Is it some sort of revenge? Did I scowl at you in the parking lot?  Did I promise to call, and not follow through?</p>

<p>Yahoo, why did you pay someone to fuck up my computer?</p>

    <updated>2013-04-11T01:02:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dragonfax.github.com/blog/2013/04/11/ideavim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>For Whom The Bell Tolls.</h3>

<p>As previously mentioned, I use VIM rather heavily, and I have some OCD behaviors when doing so, which includes hitting &lt;escape&gt; a lot. So I like to turn off the bell sounds vi makes on errors and unnecessary commands.</p>

<h3>IdeaVim</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m also a heavy user of IdeaVim plugin for IntelliJ. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use IDEs at all without those plugins that add VI operation modes to the built-in editors.</p>

<p>IdeaVim doesn&rsquo;t document very well how it differs from true VIM. The project owner has taken the philosophy of building the project based on the original VIM documentation, and not the VIM source. So much so that the documentation for the plugin is just the VIM docs copied over.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they&rsquo;ve taken no time to indicate how much of that documented behavior is implemented and how much isn&rsquo;t yet.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>One important area where VIM and IdeaVim differ is their handling of settings. IdeaVim only supports a small subset of vim commands and settings variables. But it wants to provide some convenience and backwards compatibility for existing VIM users. Their solution is to read your ~/.vimrc anyways. It simply has the behavior of silently ignoring any settings it doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>Unfortunately IdeaVim doesn&rsquo;t understand</p>

<p><code>:set noerrorbells</code></p>

<h3>It Toles for <em>Thee!</em></h3>

<p>Fortunately IdeaVim <strong>does</strong> understand</p>

<p><code>:set visualbell</code></p>

<p>And better yet, it has no implementation for visualbells, so it simply silennces the error bell when you enact this setting. I just had to ensure the visualbell option was in my .vimrc before the noerrorbells option, so the latter would take final effect in real VIM.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-10T10:54:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dragonfax.github.com/blog/2013/04/10/comfortable-vim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Evernote for taking notes for a while now. But I really miss taking notes in VIM.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a heavy VIM user. I use it for coding, through and though. So much so, that I use VIM-style editor wrapper plugins IDEs such as Eclipse and IntelliJ. Otherwise I find normal &lsquo;editors&rsquo; clunky and un-usable.</p>

<p>When it comes to coding I&rsquo;m clearly more productive, and happy in a VI like environment, with command modes, regular expressions, and no need for a mouse or arrow keys. It only made sense that I&rsquo;d use VIM for taking notes and tracking my work.</p>

<p>But the pull of Evernote to manage all that non-coding work was very strong.  The convenience of having notes online, available on every platform including mobile and web, is just something I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<h3>My Solution</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on an Evernote Command Line Client in ruby for a little while now.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/dragonfax/rnote">Rnote</a></p>

<p>Its not yet ready for prime time, yet. Its missing the final touches. But its far enough along for me to use for my own daily note-taking.</p>

<p>The real driving force behind this project was to allow me to take notes using VIM, but still backed by Evernote.</p>

<p>I can fire up:</p>

<p><code>$ rnote edit "note title"</code></p>

<p>And rnote will pull down the note, convert it to text, and open it in a copy of VIM.  Then it watches the file and saves it back to Evernote every time I save the file in my editor.</p>

<p>Returning to VIM just feels right.</p>

<h3>Realization</h3>

<p>The interesting thing I found, when returning to VIM after a long absense, was that I&rsquo;m less afraid of change in the VIM world. Its not just a matter of simple productvity via keypress count and typing speed. But there&rsquo;s apprehension when I&rsquo;m working in an editor that&rsquo;s buried in manyl layers of disparate applications.</p>

<p>When working in a text area in a browsoer, or in an editor embedded in a desktop app, there are several layers on top of that editor. Each providing their own &lsquo;modes&rsquo; and shortscuts and commands. Each taking priority over the other for different types of input. And each capable of changing the your entire world in the middle of an editing session, with one bad keypress.</p>

<p>If I fat finger a typing sequence in some custom editor, anything can happen. And the results, I&rsquo;ve found, can be unexpected and incomprehensible. I&rsquo;ve had experiences where the cursor leaps to a random location in the text, drops a few lines from the text, and starts adding new characters after breaking the formatting that was already there. Other situations have seen my input leap to another document, and start making changes there. And then there is the worse case scenerio of the window just closing altogether, lossing of editor history, and without any sort of save.</p>

<p>VIM is an environment I can predict. And its only one environment providing the UI.  No matter what happens, I know all I have to do is hit &lsquo;u&rsquo; and magically any bad typing sequence is completely undone. And best of all, if I did type something wrong, I probably know what it was from the effects that occured. Because VIM has a consice and regular interface that hasn&rsquo;t changed over the years, and doesn&rsquo;t change between nvironments.</p>

<p>Of course, I lose WYSIWYG formatting (do we still use that word?), such as bold, italic, and font sizes.  But I don&rsquo;t really miss them.  And I get back indentation, a powerful organization tool. Just ask the python guys.</p>

<h3>Plans</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning to add markdown support, so that I cna have the best of both worlds: pure text editing, but also allow for some formatting. I&rsquo;m already used to markdown elsewhere in the web, such as octopress and github.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-09T19:48:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://dragonfax.github.com/blog/2013/03/09/creating-command-line-tools-in-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>A Beginners Guide</h2>

<p>I use RubyMine without doing any rails and doing just what you ask. I write a lot of simple scripts, and large applications, both often usable from a command line.</p>

<p>I still organize my code into a &lsquo;project directory&rsquo;. And point RM at that directory. Instead of just working entirely in a file, and trying to point RM at the file alone. This seems to be what IDE&rsquo;s prefer. This lets RM create its <code>.idea</code> directory to hold all of its project related settings.</p>

<p>This may mean that some projects consist of nothing more than a directory (for the project) and a single file in that directory (the single script which is really the only content in that project).</p>

<h2>Benefits of a Project Directory</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ll soon find you add more files to any project anyways. Both additional coding and various utilities which are part of the great benefit of ruby.</p>

<ul>
<li>gem</li>
<li>rake</li>
<li>tests</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>project directory</code> pattern, also lets you version the code with popular VCS such as git, and even upload to social coding sites like github.</p>

<h2>Project Setup</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t bother with any sort of &ldquo;project type&rdquo;. In fact I don&rsquo;t create projects from with RubyMine at all. I just create a directory, and then open that directory with RM (whether from the File Menu, or via the &ldquo;mine&rdquo; command line tool that RM installs).</p>

<p><code>project/</code></p>

<p>Of course <code>project</code> isn&rsquo;t the real name of the project, or the directory I create, I&rsquo;m just using it as a generic name here. I would actually name the directory (and project) after the scripts or subject matter of the work they do.</p>

<p>NOTE: <em>currently there is a bug in the <code>mine</code> command in RM 5 where it won&rsquo;t open a second project window.</em></p>

<p>Obviously if this is a project that includes any command line scripts I&rsquo;ll put those in a <code>bin</code> directory, just for organization purposes. I don&rsquo;t like to clutter the root project directory with all sorts of things. There are too many tools that <em>require</em> their settings files in the project root, so the fewer the better.</p>

<p><code>project/bin/</code></p>

<p>Like I said, various other utilities prefer their settings files in the project root, so you may find yourself using some of them.</p>

<pre><code>project/Gemfile
project/Rakefile
project/project.gemspec
project/README.md
project/.rdoc_options
...
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as I have some automated testing for the scripts (which I admit isn&rsquo;t immediate) I put all test code under a <code>test</code> directory, but I further categorize those according to the scope of the tests or how often I would run them during development. And I&rsquo;ll go so far as to add quck Rake tasks that are just aliases for the commands necessary to run the tests. So I dont&#8217; have to remember which test runner, or type the full paths each time.</p>

<pre><code>project/test/
project/test/unit/
project/test/unit/some_component_test.rb
project/test/integration/
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, as the project grows, and I add more scripts or want to reuse some of the code within external projects, I&rsquo;ll add a <code>lib</code> directory, and use some standard practices for how to organize that.</p>

<pre><code>project/lib/
project/lib/project.rb
</code></pre>

<p>And as the project continues to grow and get more complicated, more organization of the content is required, after a little refactoring. Note the <code>cmd</code> directory to contain the actual top-level code of various workflows a particular script can go through.</p>

<pre><code>project/lib/project/
project/lib/project/other_stuff.rb
project/lib/project/cmd/
project/lib/project/cmd/one_command.rb
project/lib/project/cmd/another_command.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the original <code>project.rb</code> &lsquo;requires&rsquo; all of these lib files. Ruby loads pretty fast, so I don&rsquo;t bother too much with managing dependencies between the ruby files within the same project. Its really all about code readability.</p>

<h2>Better Command Line Apps</h2>

<p>There is nothing wrong with starting with a single script file and writing minimal boiler plate coding. And thats probably the best way to start.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

=begin

this is a script blah which does whatever

EXAMPLE

$ script &lt;options&gt; &lt;arguments

=end

def main(args)
  whatever
end

main(ARGV)
exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p>But writing even better command line apps in ruby is pretty easy. There are popular gems which handle a lot of the infrastructure for you.</p>

<p>You can start with something as simple as <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html">OptionParser</a></p>

<p>Then as you build more code in your scripts you can graduate to a bit more infrastructure with a gem like <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/methadone">Methadone</a></p>

<p>Finally, when you&rsquo;re writing full blown command line applications, with many &ldquo;internal&rdquo; commands like &ldquo;git submodule init <repo>&rdquo;, you can ascend to something much more heavy-weight like <a href="https://github.com/davetron5000/gli">GLI</a></p>

<h2>Testing Command Line Apps</h2>

<p>Unit testing is the pretty much the same, no matter what type of application your writing. You&rsquo;re not using real services or combining components, but just isolating the internal components and using them in a purely internal manner. So not much changes there for command line tools.</p>

<p>But when it comes to integration or full command-line testing of my scripts, I&rsquo;m actually a big fan of <code>cucumber/aruba</code>. I&rsquo;m not big on TDD, I&rsquo;m a bit too pragmatic for that. But for command line tools, the series of use cases is already laid out pretty plainly in the set of options available. Even for interactive commands this makes a series of <code>feature</code> files conveniently double as documentation for the tool.</p>

<pre><code>Feature:
  Create and manipulate notes in Evernote.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as me
    And I have 0 notes

  Scenario: Show note
    Given that I have 1 note named "foo" with content "bar"
    When I run `rnote show note --title "foo"`
    Then the output should contain "bar"

  Scenario: Show note, from multiple notes
    Given that I have 2 notes named "foo"
    When I run `rnote show note --title "foo"` interactively
    And I type "1"
    Then the output should contain "foo"
</code></pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As for installation and packaging for your scripts, so that they can be shared and reused by the rest of the world, look no further than the same &lsquo;gem&rsquo; utility that you&rsquo;ve already been using all along in ruby for depenencies.</p>

<p>The <code>gemspec</code> you create when writing a new gem to share, can be told about your scripts and other command line utilities. It will then wrap them up with the rest of your code, install them in a good location, and even fix up the PATH so the user can find them when the time comes.</p>

<p>In fact this works so well, your gem can be composed of nothing but these <code>bin</code> scripts. With no other re-usable code included.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dragonfax/cat-dog">cat-dog</a> is a harmless little gem I whipped up as an example for something else. It contains no lib directory at all and no other ruby other than a single command line script.</p>

<h2>Ruby Without Rails</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve run into a lot of Rails developers who aren&rsquo;t cognisant of what <em>is</em> Rails and what <em>is</em> ruby. i.e. what you&rsquo;re left with when you remove the Rails. Obviously the server and templating, databasing, MVC are all gone, as are a portion of convenience methods added to every-day objects.</p>

<p>The goods new is that you&rsquo;re still left with quite a lot. And if you find you miss something, its easy to add it back in with by including a gem or two. For instance, if you enjoy using an ORM like active-record it can be included back into your application, without rails, with little fuss.</p>

<pre><code>require 'activerecord'
</code></pre>

<h2>Full Featured RubyMine</h2>

<p>Finally, using RubyMine features more heavily during development. Everything available when working with rails is available for command line applications.</p>

<p>You can run your commands from RM and use its debugger just the same as rails.
Just like any IDE you can set up &ldquo;run&rdquo; profiles with the arguments you want to test the script on, and run or debug the script through the IDE. Personally, I never use a command-line debugger. If I need to fire up a debugger to troubleshoot some issue, then I&rsquo;ll launch the program in an IDE. The benefits of an IDE debugger with &ldquo;heads-up&rdquo; display of all the pertinent details, and visually following the script through execution, is just irreplaceable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How I choose to work has changed over the years, naturally.
Learning new technologies and techniques.
New hammers and tools to put on my belt.</p>

<p>An important part of this was how I went about
choosing what technologies to associate myself with.
I didn&rsquo;t just let people set things down in front of me, and choose my paths for me.
I constantly researched and pro-actively vetted technological choices.
Its been a constant daily regimine.</p>

<p>A notable area of focus for programmers is the choice a programming language to use for any given peice of code.
And this serves, ideally, as a great example to show how these patterns have changed over the years.</p>

<p>Let me describe this in 3 phases.</p>

<h2>When I was young</h2>

<p>When I was a new programmer, my focus was entirely on what language seemed best for me.</p>

<p>Not simply what matched my world view,
but also what forced me to absorb new ideas and concepts.
What allowed for my personal productivity, but also my personal growth.</p>

<p>Also, at this stage it was all about what the &ldquo;best langugae&rdquo; was.
As opinionated as I was, I never considered adding a &ldquo;for me&rdquo; to the end of that
statement to better qualify it as purely a personal journey.
I was in a world of absolutes, and languages were something I could qualitatively compare.</p>

<p><strong>When I was young, I chose the best language for myself.</strong></p>

<h2>As I matured</h2>

<p>As I matured and gained in experience and languages,
I grew to see that there was no superior choice, across the board.
Different tools are simply better at different jobs.</p>

<p>Its not a good carpenter that judges all of his work should be done with a hammer.
But to apply the hammer to the nails and the saw to the wood.</p>

<p>Learning a language was just pre-emptive maneuver to ensure I could make the right choice
for each task that came up. And I knew that choice would change from job to job.
Each languaging becoming a table of pros and cons, with some lending to certain techniques
but performing poorly with others.</p>

<p><strong>As I matured, I chose the right language for the project.</strong></p>

<h2>Deep into my career</h2>

<p>Years later, as I&rsquo;ve touched on most major technologies my world view has shifted yet again.</p>

<p>Truth be told, you can do pretty much anything with any programming language.</p>

<p>Yes, there are still pros and cons to languages, and language agnostic techniques as well.
There are differences in availablity and quality of 3rd party libraries and even in the communities
that follow them.</p>

<p>But what it really comes down to is not how <em>I&rsquo;m</em> going to use the language,
Or even how the project is going to use the language.
But, rather, how the people are going to use the language.</p>

<p>Those team-members I have to work with now.
Those developers that may have to maintain this code in the future.
Those engineers that may have to make other technology decisions based
on the content of the projects and work I do.</p>

<p><strong> As a Late-Career Software Engineer, I make the choice based on the people, team, and company. </strong></p>
